What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The purpose of this project was to create a program for ABCU that could read and parse a file, print out a alphanumeric order of classes and then for the chosen course print out title and prerequisites for the course.
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached this problem by using a BST data structure. I switched my original data structure to the BST, because it was faster run time and less memory used. These are important things to consider when dealing with a large data set and how to manipulate the data.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I used my resources via SNHU to help me with this program in the form of tutoring.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I really enjoyed learning and using algorisms to analyze the data and use the best possible data structure. 
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project helped me not overthink my coding. It also helped me realize that there are numerous ways to make something work and that analyzing the information needed helped me to make the code readable and adaptable.
