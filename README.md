The purpose of this project was to create a program for ABCU that could read and parse a file, print out a alphanumeric order of classes and then for the chosen course print out title and prerequisites for the course. I approached this problem by using a BST data structure. I switched my original data structure to the BST, because it was faster run time and less memory used. These are important things to consider when dealing with a large data set and how to manipulate the data. I used my resources via SNHU to help me with this program in the form of tutoring. I really enjoyed learning and using algorisms to analyze the data and use the best possible data structure. This project helped me not overthink my coding. It also helped me realize that there are numerous ways to make something work and that analyzing the information needed helped me to make the code readable and adaptable.
